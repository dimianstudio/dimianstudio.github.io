[Nasctech][nasctech], the premier provider of field OPEX management solutions for communication service providers, announced today that its STREAMLINEâ„¢ solution has been implemented by [CellularOne][cellone], headquartered in Arizona, across its rural network in the southwestern U.S.

Cellular One has deployed [STREAMLINE][streamline] to lower its operational field costs, optimize workforce management, improve process planning, and drive efficiency in the field while also leveraging existing system OSS functionality and assets.

> The Nasctech solution allows us to organize and automate our field operations, permitting us to map and mobilize our field processes thus delivering efficiency gains. The result is decreased costs.

explained Guy Turley, CTO at CellularOne

> Rather than working with many different systems across multiple contractors, we can unify our fieldoperations into a single view, saving valuable management time. In addition, [STREAMLINE][streamline] helps ensure that job activities are completed properly and validated on site, and the right information is readily available to accurately complete field tasks using the customized checklists, OSS alarms, and trouble tickets.

Mr. Turley continued:
> The KPI and trending of field information from the system means my O&M managers have the business intelligence data available to drive improved performance and move toward lowering costs both now and into the future.

Nasctech CEO Des Keary said:
> We are delighted that Cellular One decided to use our [STREAMLINE][streamline] solution to optimize their field activities and bring a higher level of efficiency to the daily operations of their tower network. We believe Nasctech's software can save up to 10% on OPEX for a typical cellular operator, as well and reducing revenue leakage through tighter preventative maintenance. We look forward to working with Cellular One to achieve its longer term goal of decreasing its operational costs across its tower network.

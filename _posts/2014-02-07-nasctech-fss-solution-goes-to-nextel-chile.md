[Nasc Technologies Ltd][nasctech] Field Operations Support System (FSS), [STREAMLINE][streamline] was selected as a part of [Nextel Chile's][nextel] plan to modernize their field operations and drive down costs. The STREAMLINE solution will, for the first time, give management real-time field visibility and control, via a data driven approach. Nextel will use STREAMLINE to drive reductions in OPEX spend, improve repair time, manage contractors, and capture network inventory. In addition, Nextel will use STREAMLINE's™ built-in trouble ticket function to manage its network related tickets, harnessing the ticket engines ability to push and pull all ticket updates real time to and from the field team, enriching these tickets with GPS and photos.

> We believe that this solution not only gives us the control of our field operations environment and cost but also could provide us a competitive advantage. Our aim is to reduce our operational cost in this area

says Jaime González, Engineering Vice President, Nextel Chile.

> Nasctech very quickly responded to our request and delivered the solution right on time. With Trouble Ticketing and integration with our two OSSs our field staff now have on-site access to everything they need from their mobile device

states Diego Alfonso Biscar Rodriguez, Network Operations Manager, Nextel Chile.

Nasctech CEO Des Keary said:

> We are absolutely thrilled to be working with Nextel Chile, a very tech savvy, creative, and innovative operator that realized the potential in using STREAMLINE to optimize their field activities and bring a higher level of efficiency to the daily operations of their mobile network. STREAMLINE has a proven ability to help mobile operators to drive down costs in the OPEX heavy area of field operations, and to drive up network quality through enabling a far more tightly managed field operation. We look forward to working with Nextel Chile to achieve its longer term goal of decreasing its operational costs across its radio network

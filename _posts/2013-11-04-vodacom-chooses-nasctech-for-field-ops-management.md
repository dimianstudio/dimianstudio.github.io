[Nasctech][nasctech], the leading provider of Field Operation Support Systems for Communication Service Providers (CSPs), announced that its [STREAMLINE][streamline] solution has been deployed by [Vodacom][vodacom] in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The announcement was made during the Enterprise Ireland trade mission to South Africa and Nigeria, led by Minister for Trade and Development, Joe Costello T.D.

STREAMLINE is a unique solution that enables CSPs to reduce their network field OPEX spend while increasing visibility and control over their field operations, including fuel management. Vodacom DRC has deployed STREAMLINE to lower costs, improve network quality and drive efficiencies in its field organisation.

STREAMLINE is based on the new industry concept of Field Operations Support Systems (FSS), which is the application of the principles and practices of OSS to the field, integrating field operations with an operatorâ€™s network operations centre and enabling critical applications and processes to be projected into the field. Network availability improves as operation efficiency ensures problems are identified in advance and pre-emptive action taken. Proactive analysis of field metrics allows quick identification problem areas, such as site fuel mismanagement and swift proactive action to be taken.

As CSPs strive for strategic advantage, network OPEX spend has become a key focus area in cost optimization. While current OSS systems only highlight issues, STREAMLINE drives entire OSS processes into the field via FSS, through rapid issue identification and converts insights into fully implementable actions. It does this through capabilities that combine a real-time view of all field operations with actionable management tools leveraging the insights via a single, structured database of all field data.

Welcoming the announcement in Cape Town Minister Costello said:

> Ireland is recognised as a centre of excellence for the development of new and innovative telecoms technologies. This trade mission to South Africa and Nigeria is focusing on the telecoms sector in particular. I congratulate Nasctech on winning business with Vodacom DRC. This is a further example of dynamic Irish companies delivering innovative solutions to the international telecoms market.

[Nasctech][nasctech], the premier provider of Field Operation Support Systems for Communication Service Providers (CSPs), today announced that its [STREAMLINE][streamline] solution has been selected by [Globe Philippines][globe]. STREAMLINE is a unique solution that enables CSPs to drive down their field OPEX spend, and achieve a strong degree of visibility and control over the management of their field operations.

Globe Philippines has deployed STREAMLINE to lower costs, improve network quality, and drive general efficiencies in its field organisation. STREAMLINE is based on the new industry concept of Field Operations Support Systems (FSS), which is the application of the principles and practices of OSS to the field, properly integrating field operations with an operator’s network operations centre and critical applications.

As the shift in focus for CSPs moves from growth to network optimisation, significant emphasis is now being placed on field cost efficiencies and quality, particularly so given that field operations is generally the number one OPEX spend area company-wide for most operators. However, current OSS systems only serve to highlight issues, but FSS drives the entire process further. It does this through capabilities that combine a real-time view of all field operations with actionable management tools leveraging the insights via a single, structured database of all field data.

Des Keary, CEO of Nasctech, explained:
> Field Operation Support Systems are integral to the effective management of field operations. STREAMLINE can save an operator up to 10 percent of field OPEX, which for an operator with over 5000 different sites to cover can translate into a saving of up to $5m per annum or more.

He added:

> STREAMLINE gives operators a real time view of all field based projects and activities, providing strong validation and visibility. Furthermore, the solution mobilises the operator’s back end, leveraging investments in OSS, ticketing platforms and more. The power and functionality of the STREAMLINE solution allows operators to drive down costs, and drive up network availability and quality.

Speaking of the engagement on behalf of Globe Philippines, Robert Tan, CTO, said

> We selected STREAMLINE to transform our field operations due to the uniqueness of the platform and the willingness of Nasctech to customise to our needs. They have demonstrated their commitment by deploying all necessary resources to deliver the project against aggressive timelines.”

Notes to the editor

CSPs already realigning their management capabilities to gain greater field focus and lower OPEX through FSS include [Digicel Papua New Guinea][digicel] (PNG) which deployed the Nasctech solution in June 2011. Digicel PNG implemented the solution to manage its mast network and field-based technical staff across a challenging topography served by a limited transport infrastructure. On April 12, 2012 Arizona-based [Cellular One][cellone] also announced its implementation of STREAMLINE across its rural network in the southwestern U.S. In April 2012 [Digicel Caribbean][digicel] deployed STREAMLINE to unify and optimise operations across its Caribbean-wide network. Just recently in April 2013, [Vodacom Congo][vodacom] ordered the STREAMLINE solution to enable the control of costs around refueling and genset maintenance, and to give visibility and control of what is happening in the field.

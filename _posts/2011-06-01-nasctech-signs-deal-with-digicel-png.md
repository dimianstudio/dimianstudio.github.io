[Nasc Technologies][nasctech], an Irish company that provide field management solutions for telecoms operators, announced today that Digicel Papua New Guinea has signed a deal to use their system to manage their mast network and field based technical staff.
[Digicel][digicel], who launched services in PNG in 2007, has developed a world class network throughout PNG offering Voice, SMS and Internet coverage to more than 4.5 million Papua New Guineans. In April 2011 Digicel PNG began a phased roll out of mobile broadband services with 3G overlay on its network in key urban centres. With PNG's challenging topography and limited transport infrastructure, the maintenance of their nationwide network of cell towers is a constant focus for the Digicel PNG team.

To address that need, Digicel PNG has worked with NascTech to develop, trial, and deploy a solution to simplify and tighten the management of their extensive network of cell towers. The solution consists of a reporting GUI, a server powering the solution, and most importantly an innovative handset app which allows the engineers to receive their work plan daily, and report back on all activities carried out. These reports are analyzed and summarized for senior management online. This provides management with a clear daily view of the operations of the mast network and enabling swifter diagnosis of potential problems which often result in a mast outage and loss of revenue.

The system also mobilises the office to a large degree for the engineers, for example presenting alarms on the app to indicate problems, and allowing the engineers to raise tickets on issues on the fly. In addition, the reporting include a large social element whereby photographs are integral to reporting, and users and management can chat on issues in a style similar to that on Facebook.

Digicel CTO Shiva Kumar said:
> The NascTech system gives us improved visibility and control over our Team in the field and the maintenance of our network, allowing for a preventative approach. This has resulted in reduced operational costs, and we would hope to see service pay for itself in the coming months in terms of savings.

Nasc Technologies CEO Des Keary said:
> We are delighted that Digicel PNG have decided to use our solution to solve their problems with the daily operations of their tower network. Digicel is a very innovative and they proved to be the ideal partner with whom to develop this unique solution. We believe NascTech's software can save up to 10% on Opex for any mobile operator in the developing world, as well as reducing capex spend and reducing revenue leakage. We look forward to working with Digicel to quickly bring the benefits of the system to other key markets in its global footprint.

I am a full-stack developer from Ukraine. Ruby, Golang, Swift are languages which I actively use now. I like travelling. I'm raising a child.

> I believe good engineers are willing and able to pick the right tool for the job, thus I prefer not to focus on specific languages, databases, or tools. Andrew Peace (apeace)

Here is a listing of some of the technologies I've worked with professionally.

### Programming Languages

Language-agnostic: willing to dive in to any programming language

* Some experience with: Go, Swift, Objective-C, PHP
* Small experience with C, C++

Comfortable using a wide range of tools and data-storage paradigms

### Infrastructure

* Expirience with setup and deployment applications on Linux servers
* Experience working with some provisioning strategies: Puppet and vanilla Bash scripts
* Active user of Vagrant, Docker, Otto.
* Some experience in AWS, Linode, DigitalOcean

### Libraries, Frameworks, and Tools

Comfortable using a wide range of frameworks and tools, with a slight preference towards smaller libraries over monolithic frameworks:
